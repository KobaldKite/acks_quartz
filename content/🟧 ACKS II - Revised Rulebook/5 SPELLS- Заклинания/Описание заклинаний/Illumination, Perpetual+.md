Arcane 3, Divine 3
Type: esoteric
Range: 480’
Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a spherical region of bright light around a target location or object. The perpetual illumination produces full daylight out to 30’; bright torchlight out to an additional 30’; and dim light out to an additional 30’ beyond that (90’ total). The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, perpetual illumination becomes perpetual tenebrosity, creating a tenebrous area of darkness. The tenebrosity reduces any light to pitch blackness within 60’ of the target location or object; bright light to dim light within 90’ of the target; and dim light to pitch blackness within 90’ of the target. The tenebrosity also blocks out lightless vision.

If an illuminated object enters the area of effect of perpetual tenebrosity, or a tenebrous object enters the area of effect of perpetual illumination, the lesser spell is immediately extinguished.

Sometimes the effects of perpetual illumination and perpetual tenebrosity may come into conflict. If so, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of perpetual illumination is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of perpetual tenebrosity, then the perpetual tenebrosity is suppressed within the perpetual area. If the caster of perpetual tenebrosity is 3 or more caster levels higher, then the perpetual illumination is suppressed within the illuminated area. In any other case, both spells are suppressed, restoring the existing ambient light level.
