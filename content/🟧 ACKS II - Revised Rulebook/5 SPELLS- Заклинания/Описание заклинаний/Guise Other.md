Arcane 5, Divine 6
Type: transmogrification
Range: touch
Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter a recipient’s shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control the recipient’s new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. The recipient’ equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw by the caster, guise other can allow the recipient to appear as a specific individual. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.
