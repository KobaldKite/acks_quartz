Arcane 5
Type: transmogrification
Range: touch
Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to see as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 60â€™ radius. Lightless vision does not enable the recipient to discern colors or to read books, maps, or scrolls, so the recipient might still need a light source for some tasks. The spell can affect one recipient, plus one additional recipient per two caster levels beyond 1st. Mass lightless vision will therefore affect five recipients at 9th level, six recipients at 11th level, and seven recipients at 13th level. Each recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work on that recipient.
