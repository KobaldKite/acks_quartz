Arcane 6
Type: elemental (earth), esoteric, movement
Range: 360’
Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to move large volumes, even to the point of altering the surface features of areas within range. By concentrating for one turn, the caster can move a volume of earth (up to 3,000 square feet at the surface and up to 10’ deep) by 60’ towards a point in range. The spell’s range extends upwards into the sky and downwards through the earth until it reaches the limit (360’) or solid rock, and can thus be used to dig pits of up to 240’ depth or build ramparts up to 240’ high. Earth’s movement cannot move stone, only soil.
