Arcane 3
Type: elemental (earth), movement
Range: 360’
Duration: instantaneous

This spell flings one or more objects or creatures within range and line of sight a distance of up to 20’. The caster can target one creature or object per caster level. Each object or creature must weigh 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level or less. Alternatively, the caster can target a single creature or object weighing 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level squared. Each targeted creature can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell does not affect the creature. If the save fails, it is affected as above.

The affected creatures or objects can be flung in any direction the caster chooses. If the caster wishes to fling one or more of the affected creatures or objects into another creature, or onto a specific hard-to-reach location (such as a balcony or pit), he must make a successful attack throw. A throw of a single creature or object may be aimed without penalty, but each additional object or creature imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the caster’s attack throws. If an aimed throw misses, it scatters like thrown oil.

| creature / object’s Weight                 | damage dealt        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| up to 4 stone (≤40 lbs)                    | 1d6                |
| 4 stone to 8 stone (41 – 80 lbs)           | 2d6                |
| 9 stone to 15 stone (81 – 150 lbs)         | 3d6  (5’ radius)   |
| 16 stone to 30 stone (151 – 300 lbs)       | 4d6  (10’ radius)  |
| 31 stone to 60 stone (301 – 600 lbs)       | 5d6  (15’ radius)  |
| 61 stone to 120 stone (601 – 1,200 lbs)    | 6d6  (15’ radius)  |
| 121 stone to 240 stone (1,201 – 2,400 lbs) | 8d6  (15’ radius)  |
| 241 stone to 392 stone (2,401 – 4,800 lbs) | 10d6  (20’ radius) |
Creatures or objects flung into walls or other hard surfaces will suffer bludgeoning damage. Creatures or objects will also deal bludgeoning damage to whatever they strike. The amount of damage will be based on the flung creature or object’s weight, as shown on the adjoining table. Large flung objects will also deal damage to an area of effect around their point of impact. Creatures in this area of effect can avoid taking any damage with a successful Blast saving throw, but creatures actually struck by the flung object cannot avoid the damage. Damage from flung objects converts into shp at a rate of 1 shp per 5 points of damage.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 9th level mage, is supporting a company of mercenaries during a siege. The mercenaries are suffering from the fire of a light catapult (120 st). Quintus casts force of impetus, enabling him to fling up to 9 objects of up to 18 stone each, or a single object of up to (9 × 9 × 2) 162 stone. He opts for the latter, and flings the light catapult onto its own four crew members. He makes a successful attack throw against one of the crew’s AC. That crew member takes 5d6  damage (and dies!). The other three crew members, all within 15’, must make Blast saves or suffer 5d6  damage each. The light catapult itself takes 5d6/5  structural damage, enough to destroy it.
