Divine 4
Type: enchantment
Range: self
Duration: 3 turns

This spell can inspire awe and dread in the hearts of the wicked. The means by which this occurs will depend on the caster’s spell signature. Each evil creature that begins its initiative or moves within 30’ of the caster must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature that round. If the save fails, the creature falters that round. A faltering creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws against the caster.

For purposes of this spell, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead, or incarnations or enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment. It can affect incarnations and undead even if these creatures are ordinarily immune to enchantment effects.

The reverse of this spell, inspire horror, can cause fear and terror in the hearts of the kind, targeting good creatures rather than evil. For purposes of this spell, good creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently good creatures such as incarnations or enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment.
