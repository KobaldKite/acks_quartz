Arcane 5, Divine 5
Type: detection
Range: 3 miles
Duration: concentration

This spell can magically reveal the existence of lairs within 3 miles (i.e. within the area of a 6-mile hex). The Judge should make a Searching proficiency throw on behalf of the caster after three turns (30 minutes) of concentration. The target value for the throw is 4+, or 2+ if the caster has Land Surveying proficiency. If the throw fails, the spell immediately ends. If the throw succeeds, the caster learns the direction and approximate distance to the nearest unrevealed lair and can continue searching with the spell for other lairs. The throw automatically fails if there are no lairs in range, or if all lairs within range have been revealed by the spell. Because the roll is made in secret by the Judge, the caster cannot be certain whether the spell has ended because of chance or because there are no more lairs to find.
