Divine 5
Type: healing
Range: 30’
Duration: instantaneous

This spell immediately heals one or more living recipients. The healing circle can affect one creature per caster level within 30’. Each recipient instantly regains 1d6+1 hit points. The spell can also be used to cure paralysis in one, some, or all of the recipients, but does not then cure any damage in them. The spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

Healing circle can be used to treat several unconscious combatants’ wounds simultaneously from a safe distance. However, because it only heals 1d6+1 damage, it only counts as a 1st level spell that grants a +1 bonus on the Mortal Wounds table (p. 517).
