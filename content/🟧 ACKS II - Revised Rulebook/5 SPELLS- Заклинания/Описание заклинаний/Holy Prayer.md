Divine 3
Type: movement
Range: 90’
Duration: 1 round

This spell imbues up to one recipient per caster level with powerful divine energies. On its next initiative, each recipient can move at double its normal speed and can make one additional attack. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.
