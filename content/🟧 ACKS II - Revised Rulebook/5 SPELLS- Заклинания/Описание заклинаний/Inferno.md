Arcane 4
Type: blast, elemental (fire)
Range: 225’
Duration: 1 round per caster level

This spell conjures a terrible inferno from the Sphere of Elemental Fire itself centered on a target point. The inferno is 30’ in diameter and 10’ high and burns everything within. It deals 1d10  damage each round to creatures that begin their initiative in its area of effect or enter its area of effect on their initiative. The creatures receive no saving throw.

The inferno can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d10 × 3  structural damage to wooden structures and 1d10  structural damage to stone structures on the caster’s initiative number each round. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The inferno causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. The inferno lasts until dispelled or the spell’s duration expires.
