Arcane 4, Divine 6
Type: illusion
Range: special
Duration: special

This spell makes a structure or terrain feature appear as a different type of structure or feature (e.g. field into forest, grassland into desert, hill into a castle, etc.). Illusory terrain requires a full turn to cast, during which time the caster must be in or on the structure or terrain feature to be affected. The structure or feature to be affected must fit within a 480’ diameter sphere. (Multiple castings of illusory terrain can be used to cover larger structures or features.)

Once the spell is cast, the illusory terrain looks, sounds, smells, and feels exactly like the type of feature that the caster has selected. The spell expires immediately if a sapient creature moves into the illusory terrain. (The caster can move out of the terrain after casting the spell without causing it to expire.) Mindless or bestial creatures do not cause the spell to expire, and instead simply vanish from sight when they enter the illusory terrain.

A creature who encounters illusory terrain and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the terrain is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the illusory terrain again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he sees a deer wander into “the lake” and vanish, etc.)
