Arcane 3, Divine 4
Type: illusion
Range: touch
Duration: 1 day

The spell causes the recipient creature or object to become invisible to ordinary sight and even lightless vision. An invisible creature can still see itself. Otherwise, not even the caster can see the recipient without the aid of discern invisible or true seeing. The recipient can still be heard unless it is inaudible, noiseless, or sneaking. An invisible creature counts as hidden to all creatures unable to see until the spell ends.

If the recipient of the spell is a creature that is carrying and/or wearing items, the recipient’s carried and/or worn items vanish as well. However, any part of any item that the recipient carries that extends more than 10’ from it is visible. If the recipient drops or sets down invisible items it is carrying, the items immediately become visible. Conversely, if the recipient picks up a visible item and tucks into his clothing or containers, the item becomes invisible. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so, thus creating the effect of a visible light with no visible source. If the recipient of the spell is dusted with substances such as flour or powder, its dusted form remains visible until the end of its next initiative.

If the recipient casts a spell or attacks a creature, the spell expires at the end of the recipient’s initiative (i.e. after the attack is made or spell is cast). Attacking an unattended stationary object, or cleverly causing a creature harm indirectly, does not cause the spell to expire. The spell lasts at most 1 day.

The sun’s rays proceed from the sun along straight lines and are reflected from every object at equal angles. Now, what is true of daylight is true of all light, which is why a mere candle can make visible that which is hidden. But by illusionary science, that which is straight can be bent, and by this means, can a thing be made to vanish from the light.
