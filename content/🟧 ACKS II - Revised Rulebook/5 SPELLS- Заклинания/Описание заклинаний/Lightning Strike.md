Arcane 3, Divine 3
Type: blast, elemental (air), esoteric
Range: 480’
Duration: 1 turn / caster level

This spell can only be cast when a thunderstorm is within range. (If one is not present, of course, a high-level caster can summon one using summon weather). Once the spell is cast, the caster can thereafter call down one lightning strike per turn (10 minutes). Calling down a strike counts as casting a spell, so the caster must remain stationary, take no other action, and avoid being interrupted on the round he calls down the lightning strike. (If the caster gets interrupted, the lightning strike does not arrive, but it does not count as his use for that turn; he can try again the next round.)

Once called, the lightning strike streaks down from the sky to hit an area 20’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature take 1d6  damage per caster level (maximum 8d6). If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

The lightning strike can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6  structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.)

If the caster calls the lightning strike on a point that is underground or inside structure, the lightning will strike the ceiling or surface above the target point. If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the lightning strike will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

The caster does not have to make a lightning strike every turn but cannot accumulate them, either. Lighting strikes remain available until either the spell duration or the storm ends.
