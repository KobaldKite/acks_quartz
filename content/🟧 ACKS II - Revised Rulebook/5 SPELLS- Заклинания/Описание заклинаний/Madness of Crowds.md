Arcane 6
Type: enchantment
Range: 240’
Duration: 1 turn

This spell can drive mad any living humanoid targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 60’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each target of 2HD or more in the area of effect must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target has fewer than 2 HD, the target becomes mad. A mad creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:


| 2d6  | Behavior                                                                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2–5  | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible). |
| 6–8  | do nothing but babble incoherently.                                                                  |
| 9–12 | Attack the creature’s own party, if any.                                                             |


Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking mad creatures. A mad creature which is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still mad at the start of its initiative. A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. The effects last until the spell expires or until they are dispelled or extinguished by remove curse.
