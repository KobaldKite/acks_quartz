Arcane 6
Type: enchantment
Range: 45’
Duration: perpetual

This spell can totally enslave a living humanoid target to the caster’s will. If the target has fewer than 2 HD, it is automatically enslaved. If the target has 2 HD or more, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is enslaved until the effect is dispelled.

When the caster is present, the enslaved creature will respond to the caster’s orders and do whatever is commanded of it. If the caster and the enslaved creature cannot communicate due to a language barrier or some other situation, the enslaved creature will act in the interest of the caster to serve and protect it as best it can. Even if the caster attacks the enslaved creature or its friends, it will not defend itself or take arms against the caster.

When the caster is not present, the enslaved creature will be confused and passive. It will be capable of carrying out routine activities, but cannot use spells or magic items or make complex decisions. Characters familiar with the enslaved creature before its enslavement will be able to tell that something is amiss, although they may not know it is enslaved unless they discern bewitchment. Enslave humanoid counts as a bewitchment for purposes of discern magic and discern bewitchment.
