Divine 5
Type: detection, esoteric
Range: touch
Duration: until it happens

This spell grants the caster a prophetic insight into what the future holds for the creature touched. While the exact date and place are not known, a general indication of the creature’s fate will be provided. The specific fate revealed may be determined by the Judge, or rolled randomly on the table below.

Fate is not entirely unalterable; a character can still die from gross stupidity and recklessness, or by willfully avoiding his fate (e.g. suicide). In most cases, however, a character’s fate will be fulfilled. A character who has not yet fulfilled his fate gains a +4 bonus when rolling on the Mortal Wounds tables (p. 517). A character who has already fulfilled his fate suffers a -4 penalty when rolling on the Mortal Wounds tables. The Judge is the final arbiter of whether a character has fulfilled his fate. Henchmen and hirelings are always reluctant to learn their fate, and forcing them to do so counts as a calamity (p. 166). A character cannot have two or more fates simultaneously. A character who is slain with an unfulfilled fate and later restored to life retains his fate. A character who fulfills his fate cannot have another fate unless he is slain and restored to life.
