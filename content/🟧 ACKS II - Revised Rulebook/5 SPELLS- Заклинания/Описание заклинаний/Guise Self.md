Arcane 4, Divine 5
Type: transmogrification
Range: self
Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter his shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control his new shapeâ€™s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. His equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, guise self can allow the caster to appear as a specific individual. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.
