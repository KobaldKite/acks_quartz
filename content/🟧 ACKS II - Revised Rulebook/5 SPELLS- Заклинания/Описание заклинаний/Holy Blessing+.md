Divine 2
Type: esoteric, protection
Range: self
Duration: 6 turns

This spell fills the caster and up to 30 allied recipients of his choice within 15’ with courage and hope. Each blessed recipient gains a bonus of +1 to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The spell cannot affect creatures who have attacked enemies on their most recent initiative, so it is best cast before a battle begins.

Divine casters of 7th level or higher can use holy blessing to create holy water. One casting of holy blessing will transform 1 pint of ordinary water into holy water. Casting holy blessing in this manner demands a sacrifice to the caster’s deity worth at least 10gp. Once created, holy water will retain its potency indefinitely so long as it is kept in the vial it was blessed in. See the Equipment Descriptions in Chapter 4 for information on holy water.

The reverse of holy blessing is called unholy blessing. It fills the caster and up to 30 allied recipients of his choice within 15’ with fanatical hate and zealotry. Each recipient gains a bonus of +1 to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. Unholy blessing can also be used by chaotic divine casters of 7th level or higher, in conjunction with a sacrifice of at least 10gp, to create a vial of unholy water. Unholy water has beneficial effects when used in the animation of the dead. See animate undead, above.
