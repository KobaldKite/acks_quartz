Arcane 3
Type: enchantment
Range: 90’
Duration: perpetual

This spell can afflict a living humanoid creature in range with a terrible madness. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target becomes mad. A mad creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:


| 2d6  | Behavior                                                                                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2–5  | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible) |
| 6–8  | do nothing but babble incoherently.                                                                 |
| 9–12 | Attack the creature’s own party, if any.                                                            |
Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking the mad creature. A mad creature who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still mad at the start of its initiative. A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. The duration is perpetual, so the madness lasts until the spell is dispelled or extinguished by remove curse or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the effect.
