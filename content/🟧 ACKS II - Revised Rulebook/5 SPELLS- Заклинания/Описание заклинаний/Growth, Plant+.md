Arcane 4, Divine 5
Type: transmogrification
Range: 180’
Duration: perpetual

This spell transforms a target patch of ordinary vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) up to 3,000 square feet in size into a dense overgrown thicket. The thicket is impassable to creatures of man-size or large size. Such creatures can hack their way through the thicket using an axe or short sword at a combat speed of 5’ per round. Small creatures and huge, gigantic, or colossal creatures do not need to hack their way through but move at half normal speed.

The reverse form, plant shrinkage, transforms a target thicket of overgrown and impassable vegetation into a patch of grass and brush that can be easily traversed.

Both plant growth and plant shrinkage are perpetual in duration, lasting until dispelled or countered by the reversed spell, or until the caster dies or stops sustaining it. Neither spell has any effect on plant creatures of any sort.
