Arcane 6, Divine 6 
Type: elemental (water), esoteric, movement

Duration: 10 turns

This powerful spell can be cast in several different ways, depending on the caster’s purpose:

- If cast on a target body of water, it reduces the water’s depth by up to 2’ per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water depth is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10’ long per caster level.
- If cast on a point of deep and open ocean, it creates a whirlpool with a diameter of 10’ per caster level and a depth of 2’ per caster level. See Nautical Hazards (p. 320) for the effects of whirlpools.
- If cast on a water elemental, marid, or other creature from the elemental sphere of water, it functions as a halt monster spell.
