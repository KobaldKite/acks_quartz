Arcane 3
Type: movement
Range: touch
Duration: 1 turn per level

This spell allows the recipient to fly in any direction at a combat speed of 120’ per round and an exploration speed of 360’ per turn. The speed is reduced by encumbrance, however, and the recipient cannot fly carrying more weight than its maximum load.

Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the recipient can attack or cast spells normally. If a flight spell is dispelled or its duration expires while the recipient is flying, the former recipient of flight will plummet from the air.
