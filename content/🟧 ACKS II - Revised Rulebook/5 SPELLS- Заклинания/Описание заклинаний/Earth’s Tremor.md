Arcane 4
Type: blast, elemental (earth)
Range: 0’
Duration: concentration

This spell causes the earth near the caster to begin to spasm and shake violently. The caster can choose to have the tremor radiate outward from him along the ground in all directions to a 50’ radius, or blast outward along the ground in a flat cone 150’ long and 100’ wide. Each round of the duration, each creature that starts its initiative in or enters the affected area must make a Blast saving throw. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6  damage and is knocked prone. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers no damage and retains its footing. Structures in the area of effect suffer 1  structural damage per round per 10’ square area. For example, a 100’ long, 10’ wide in the area of effect would take 100  structural damage per round.

An earth’s tremor can only be brought forth if the caster is standing on soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock and it is halted by deep water (5’ or more). An earth’s tremor ends when the caster halts or loses concentration.
