Arcane 3, Divine 4
Type: transmogrification
Range: touch
Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to see as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 60â€™ radius. Lightless vision does not enable the recipient to discern colors or to read books, maps, or scrolls, so the recipient might still need a light source for some tasks. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.
