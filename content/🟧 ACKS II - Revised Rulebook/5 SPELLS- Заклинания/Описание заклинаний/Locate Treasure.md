Arcane 4
Type: detection
Range: 540’
Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a treasure hoard within 540’. For purposes of this spell, a treasure hoard is a collection of copper, silver, gold, platinum, and gems within a 10’ × 10’ area worth at least 50gp in total. If there are several treasure hoards in range, the caster senses the direction and distance to the most valuable one. If there are no treasure hoards in range, the caster senses nothing. If treasure comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. Locate treasure is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing).
