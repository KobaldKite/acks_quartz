Arcane 3
Type: elemental (air), transmogrification
Range: 90’
Duration: 6 turns

This spell can cause a target creature of man-size or smaller to immediately be transformed into a translucent cloud of gas. If the creature is a willing recipient of the spell, it is automatically transformed. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed. Once transformed, any objects the creature was carrying or wearing immediately fall to the floor.

While in gaseous form, a creature cannot attack, cast spells, speak, or use magic items or equipment. It gains a combat speed of 40’ and an exploration speed of 120’ per turn. The gaseous creature’s movement makes no noise and it can flow below doors and other small spaces that are not sealed airtight. A gaseous creature has an AC of 11 and is immune to mundane damage.
