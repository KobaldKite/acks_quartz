Arcane 5
Type: death
Range: 45â€™
Duration: 1 day

This horrific spell flays the flesh off of one or more eligible corpses in range, then animates the bloody skins as flay fiends (see Monstrous Manual for characteristics). The caster can flay and animate a number of dead corpses up to his caster level each time he casts the spell. A flay fiend can only be created from the corpse of a humanoid with 1 Baseline HD or less with mostly intact skin; burned corpses, decayed corpses older than 2 weeks, and corpses of larger humanoids cannot be used. The flay fiends created by this spell last until destroyed or dispelled, or until one day elapses. The flay fiends thereafter crumble into dust.
