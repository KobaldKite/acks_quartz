Arcane 3
Type: blast, elemental (earth)
Range: 180’
Duration: instantaneous

This spell can impale one target creature per level of the caster with a pillar of jagged rock that erupts from the earth. All of the targets must be within a single 30’ diameter sphere. The caster can choose which creatures in the area of effect are targeted. The caster must make an attack throw against each target. On a successful attack, the target suffers 5d6  damage. On a failed attack, the target narrowly dodges the impaling pillar. The pillars immediately crumble to dust after the attack.

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers is set upon by a band of 8 ogres. A fierce melee ensues, into which Quintus, a 6th level mage, casts earth’s teeth. Quintus can target 6 creatures, so he selects 6 of the ogres. Quintus must make an attack throw against each ogre (AC 4), As a 6th level mage, Quintus has an attack throw of 9+, so he will need to roll 13 or more to impale each ogre. He will deal 5d6  damage to each ogre he successfully impales.
