Arcane 3
Type: blast, elemental (fire)
Range: 360’
Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar into a 20’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 points of  damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

To cast the spell, the caster points his finger in the direction he wants to fire while mentally designating the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to explode. A pea-sized sphere of fire then shoots from the pointing finger and, unless it impacts an interposing barrier before reaching its specified distance, explodes into the fireball at the target point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he must make a successful missile attack throw (without range adjustments) to pass through the opening. Otherwise, the spell strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The fireball can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6  structural damage per caster level to wood structures and one-third that to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. If the damage caused to an interposing structure is enough to shatter or break through it, the fireball will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.
