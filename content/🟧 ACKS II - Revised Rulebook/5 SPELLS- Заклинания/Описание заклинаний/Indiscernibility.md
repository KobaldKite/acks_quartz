Arcane 4, Divine 4
Type: esoteric, protection
Range: touch
Duration: 1 day

This spell protects the recipient touched from being spied on by any type of locate or scrying spell. The spellâ€™s magical protection also prevents locating or scrying on the items the recipient is wearing and on his present location. The caster attempting to scry upon the recipient, item, or location will learn it is being magically protected, but will not gain any other information. If the recipient himself can cast scry, he still has a chance to notice the attempt, even though he is protected from the spell (see p. 243).

In addition, indiscernibility also allows the recipient to automatically refuse a telepathic link from a caster using telepathy. The caster attempting to contact the recipient will know the recipient is magically protected.
