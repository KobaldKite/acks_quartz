Arcane 5
Type: blast, elemental (water)
Range: 360’
Duration: 1

This spell conjures a 20’ diameter storm of freezing, razor-sharp hail that rains down from the heavens around a target point. Any creature that begins its initiative in the ice storm, or which enters the ice storm on its initiative, suffer 1d4 points of  damage per caster level, or half that amount with a successful Blast saving throw. Any movement through the ice storm’s area of effect is at half normal rate.

The ice storm can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d4  structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) Any non-magical fires (burning pitch, campfires, torches, etc.) within the cone are automatically extinguished.

If this spell is cast indoors or underground, the ice storm will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the ice storm will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.
