Divine 3
Type: protection
Range: self
Duration: 1 turn

This spell makes the caster immune to mundane damage dealt by evil creatures with melee or missile attacks. Attacks made by evil creatures with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell. Evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead, or incarnations or enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment.

Reversed, this spell becomes invulnerability to good and protects the caster from hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s, and from inherently good creatures such as incarnations or enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment.
