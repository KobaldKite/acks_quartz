Arcane 3, Divine 4
Type: illusion
Range: touch
Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to move and fight noiselessly. It counts as sneaking until the effect ends. Should the recipient carry or pick up any items, these items also become noiseless so long as they remain in the creature’s possession. For instance, a bell carried by the recipient would not toll, and a bag of coins would not jingle. Conversely, any items leaving the recipient’s possession regain their normal audibility if fired, dropped or put down. The spell ends if the recipient speaks, suffers damage, fails a saving throw, or casts a spell. Merely attacking or interacting with objects does not end the effect. The spell lasts at most 1 day.
