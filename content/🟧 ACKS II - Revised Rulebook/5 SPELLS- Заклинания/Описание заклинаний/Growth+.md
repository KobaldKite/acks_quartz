Arcane 3, Divine 4
Type: transmogrification
Range: touch
Duration: 12 turns

This spell enlarges a humanoid recipient by one size category. All equipment worn or carried by the recipient is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the recipient’s possession instantly returns to its normal size. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

When enlarged, the recipient becomes two times as tall and eight times as heavy as he is ordinarily. His strength increases proportionately, such that he gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every melee or thrown attack that deals physical damage. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every melee or thrown attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6) that deals physical damage. The damage dealt becomes extraordinary if it was not already. The recipient also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. (Any equipment he was carrying or wearing now also has twice as much encumbrance.)

The reverse of this spell, shrinking, reduces a humanoid recipient and everything he carries by one size category. A shrunk recipient becomes half as tall and one-eighth as heavy as he is ordinarily. His strength decreases proportionately, such that he suffers -2 to melee attack throws, deals half damage with physical attacks, and halves his carrying capacity. He also takes a -8 penalty to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. (Any equipment he was carrying or wearing now have half as much encumbrance.) The effects are not all bad, however; the recipient gains a +4 bonus to Hiding and Sneaking. If unproficient, he is treated as proficient with a throw of 14+.

This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength. If a creature under the effect of a growth spell is subject to shrinking, or vice versa, both spells are cancelled.
