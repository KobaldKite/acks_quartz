Arcane 5
Type: elemental (earth), transmogrification
Range: 180’
Duration: 3d6 days (perpetual)

This spell changes a volume of natural, uncut, unworked rock into an equal volume of mud. The volume transformed can be up to 3,000 square feet at the surface and up to 10’ deep. Magical stone is not affected by the spell, nor are buildings, bridges, and other structures made of worked stone.

Earth’s mire is most commonly cast in preparation for a pitched battle to create fields of nearly impassable ground. Creatures entering the area of the mud become mired in the deep morass. Mired creatures are slowed to 1/10th their normal movement speed and suffer a -2 penalty to AC.

If the spell is cast underground on a cave’s rock ceiling, the mud immediately falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool, forming a mire (as above). When this occurs, any creature in the affected area must make a Blast saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers 8d6  damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. At the Judge’s discretion, transforming a large volume of ceiling rock in a cave can precipitate a wider cave-in as the area’s structural integrity becomes compromised.

Mud created by this spell remains such until the duration expires or the reverse of this spell (earth’s hardening) restores the rock to its original substance. The volume transformed by the reversed version is identical, but the transmutation is perpetual. When mud becomes rock, the shape of the area may be different, as the mud may have moved or shifted.
