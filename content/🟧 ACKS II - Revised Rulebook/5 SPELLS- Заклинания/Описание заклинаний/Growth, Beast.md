Divine 3
Type: transmogrification
Range: touch
Duration: 12 turns

This spell can enlarge a target animal of large size or smaller. The animal can, but does not have to, make a Spells saving throw to resist. Most animals will choose to make the save, but if the animal is bewitched by the caster, has been befriended by the caster using Beast Friendship or speak with beasts, or was personally raised and trained by the caster, the animal will trust the caster enough to refuse its saving throw.

If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails or is refused, the target animal is enlarged. If an enlarged animal has not previously been enlarged or was not cautioned as to what would occur through, e.g. speak with beasts, it will become panicked and confused when enlarged. Treat the animal as subject to the effects of incite madness spell until it returns to its original size.

The effects of beast growth are otherwise identical to that of growth, above. Note that the spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
