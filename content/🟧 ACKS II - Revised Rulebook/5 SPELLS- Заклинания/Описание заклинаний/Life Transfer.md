Arcane 5
Type: death
Range: 120’
Duration: concentration (1 round/level)

This spell transfers the life force from one living creature in range (the victim) to another living creature in range (the beneficiary). When the spell is cast, the victim must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the life transfer begins. At the end of the caster’s initiative each round, starting on the round he cast the spell, the victim suffers 1d6+1  damage while the beneficiary is healed an equal amount of damage. The victim can be drained until its hp are reduced to a negative value equal in magnitude to its maximum hp. The life transfer continues until the victim can no longer be drained, the effect is dispelled, the caster loses concentration, or one round per caster level elapses.
