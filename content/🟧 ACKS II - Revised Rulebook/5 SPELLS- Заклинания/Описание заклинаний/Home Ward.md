Divine 6
Type: protection
Range: 15’
Duration: indefinite

This spell places a protective ward on the structure touched. The structure can be up to 10,000 cubic feet in size. For instance, the spell could protect a 20’ square 25’ tall tower or a 33’ square 9’ tall cottage. (Larger structures can be protected by multiple wards.) Once placed, a home ward remains until either dispelled or triggered by an incarnation entering the structure it wards. When the home ward is triggered, the incarnation that triggered it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is dispelled back to its home plane. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. In either case, the home ward vanishes. A home ward leaves no visible mark on the structure it protects, but its presence can be revealed by discern magic, true seeing, or similar spells.
