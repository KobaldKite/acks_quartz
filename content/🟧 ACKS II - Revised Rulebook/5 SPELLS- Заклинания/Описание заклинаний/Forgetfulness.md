Arcane 5, Divine 5
Type: enchantment
Range: 30’
Duration: perpetual

This spell can induce forgetfulness in 2d4 living humanoid targets. If a target has fewer than 2 HD, it is automatically affected by the spell. If a target has 2 HD or more, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that target. If the save fails, that target is affected by the spell. Affected creatures lose all memory of the minute (1 round) before the spell was cast and form no memories of anything that happens during the subsequent 10 minutes (1 turn) after the spell was cast.

While under the immediate influence of the spell, the affected creatures are mesmerized, as if lost in thought or daydreaming. If attacked, they will defend themselves, but otherwise they will not interfere with the activities of other creatures. When the spell ends, the creatures are not aware of having been affected; they simply feel as if they have come out of a daydream or lapse in attention.

Forgetfulness is perpetual. Affected creatures regain memories lost to this spell when the effect is dispelled or expires due to the caster’s death or decision not to continue to sustain it. Affected creatures do not recover memories they never formed, i.e. anything that happened in the subsequent 10 minutes after the spell was cast. Forgetfulness counts as a bewitchment for purposes of discern magic and discern bewitchment.
