Arcane 4, Divine 5
Type: transmogrification
Range: touch
Duration: 3 turns

This spell imbues the recipient with the strength of a giant. The recipient gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every melee or thrown attack that deals physical damage. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every melee or thrown attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6) that deals physical damage. The damage dealt becomes extraordinary if it was not already.

As an attack, the recipient can hurl a boulder to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6  damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, the recipient functions like a heavy ballista. He does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if he has sufficient supply. He cannot cleave with boulders.

The recipient also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws, doubles his normal carrying capacity, and counts as huge for size-adjusted saving throws. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

This spell cannot be combined with any other magical effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the recipient’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength — a weak character who is enchanted with this spell has the strength of a weak giant, while a very strong character would gain the strength of a very strong giant!
