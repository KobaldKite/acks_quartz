Divine 5
Type: blast, elemental (fire)
Range: 90’
Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a burning pillar of divine fire 30’ high and 10’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the pillar must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 6d8   damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The fiery pillar can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 6d8/3   structural damage to wood structures and 6d8/10   damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite.
