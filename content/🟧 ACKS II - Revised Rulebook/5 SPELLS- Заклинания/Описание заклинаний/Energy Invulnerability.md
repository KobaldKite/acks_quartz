Arcane 4, Divine 4
Type: elemental (any), protection
Range: touch
Duration: 6 turns

This spell grants the recipient invulnerability against one type of energy for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, or seismic. The recipient becomes immune to both mundane and extraordinary damage of that type. It automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal the chosen damage type, and ignores mundane and extraordinary damage of the chosen damage type.
